Workload 5: Workload 4 runs the possibility of hitting the max memory cap; Workload 5
more rigorously tests the boundary by allocating several blocks, the last of which 
comes as close as possible to the memory bound without overflowing, then frees.

Workload 6: Workload 6, again, tests the max memory cap, which is only addressed in
Workload 4 of the given sets.  This mallocs two blocks, each of which can be anywhere
between the smallest possible size and the max memory capacity.  The way that the
malloc max bounds are set allows the second block to exceed the memory capacity, and
the code runs demonstrably smoothly when faced with this issue.
